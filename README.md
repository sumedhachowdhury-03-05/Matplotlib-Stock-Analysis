📊 Matplotlib Stock Analysis – Financial EDA (Python)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of financial time series using Python and Matplotlib’s Object-Oriented (OO) interface.
This project demonstrates clean, professional, and maintainable data visualization practices within a Jupyter Notebook, with a strong focus on financial data analysis.

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a highly documented Python Jupyter Notebook (financial_eda_matplotlib.ipynb) that showcases best practices for visualizing financial time series data using the Matplotlib library in Python.

The core objective of this project is to demonstrate exclusive use of Matplotlib’s Object-Oriented (OO) API (fig, ax = plt.subplots()), which is the industry-recommended approach for building complex, scalable, and production-ready visualizations.

The notebook simulates one year of stock price data and applies exploratory data analysis techniques to examine trends, volatility, and return distributions.
